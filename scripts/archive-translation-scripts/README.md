# Translation Scripts Archive

**Date Archived**: December 16, 2024  
**Purpose**: These scripts were used for the massive translation campaign (46.4% → 99.91%)

## Status

✅ **Translation Complete**: 1096/1097 strings (99.91%)  
✅ **Mission Accomplished**: All scripts have fulfilled their purpose

## Contents

This directory contains 31+ batch translation scripts that were created to translate the LazyBookings plugin from English to German:

### Original Batch Scripts (1-16)
- Translated initial 509 strings (46.4%)
- Categories: Admin, Bookings, Forms, Validation, Payments, etc.

### Comprehensive Campaign (17-28)
- Translated 587 additional strings
- Reached 99.91% completion
- Handled special UTF-8 characters

## Why Keep These?

1. **Future Updates**: If new English strings are added to the plugin, these scripts can be adapted
2. **Documentation**: Shows the translation methodology
3. **Reference**: Can be used as templates for other plugins

## When to Delete

You can safely delete this entire directory if:
- ✅ The plugin is stable and no more strings will be added
- ✅ You don't plan to use the scripts as reference
- ✅ Disk space is a concern

## Recommendation

**Keep for now** - They only take ~500 KB and may be useful for future updates.

Delete after 6-12 months if no new translations are needed.
